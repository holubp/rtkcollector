# User Workflows

RtkCollector V1 is a receiver recorder and correction router. It is not a GIS
app: there are no maps, shapefiles, feature forms or survey-cartography project
tools.

## Plain Rover Recording

Use this when you want a byte-exact receiver log without external corrections.

User flow:

1. Connect the receiver.
2. Select the receiver profile.
3. Start plain rover recording.
4. Leave the phone screen on or off; the foreground recording service owns the
   session.
5. Stop recording and export the session folder.

The session records the raw receiver stream, events, quality logs and the
receiver's in-device solution where available. Raw observations are requested
where the receiver supports them.

## Rover With NTRIP Fed To Receiver

Use this when Android should act as the NTRIP client and feed RTCM corrections
to a capable rover receiver.

User flow:

1. Select the rover receiver profile.
2. Configure NTRIP caster host, port and mountpoint.
3. Store credentials as secret references; passwords are never written to
   `session.json`.
4. Start recording.
5. The app records receiver RX, correction input, TX bytes sent to the receiver,
   receiver solution, quality events and NTRIP state.

The receiver's internal RTK float/fix solution is separate from any future
Android-side solution engine.

## Temporary-Base Preparation

Use this when you want to place a temporary base close to the rover, often with
better sky visibility than a distant permanent base. A stationary car roof in
open sky can be useful if the antenna mount is stable and multipath is
acceptable.

Temporary-base preparation is not a final fixed-base mode. It records the data
needed to produce one or more base-position candidates later.

Required recording behaviour:

- record the raw receiver byte stream unchanged;
- request raw observations at at least `1 Hz` where the receiver supports raw
  observations;
- always record the receiver's normal in-device solution;
- request and record receiver PPP solution separately where the receiver profile
  supports PPP;
- optionally feed CORS/EUREF/NTRIP corrections to the receiver.

Base-position candidate preference:

1. static RTK against a known CORS/EUREF/local base;
2. PPP/static processing;
3. receiver in-device PPP solution;
4. long averaging of non-PPP in-device solution as fallback;
5. receiver survey-in where available and explicitly understood;
6. manual known point or external `base-position.json`.

Long averaging is fallback evidence. It is not equivalent to static RTK or PPP.

## Fixed Base From Accepted Coordinate

Use this only after a base-position candidate has been accepted or an external
known coordinate has been imported.

User flow:

1. Select a receiver profile that supports fixed-base mode.
2. Select or import the accepted base position.
3. Verify frame/datum, epoch, antenna height and antenna reference point.
4. Start fixed-base operation.
5. Record base status and RTCM output/extracted RTCM where supported.

A fixed base must not start directly from a temporary-base recording. The base
coordinate must be accepted first.

## Replay/Test

Use replay/test sessions for deterministic parser, quality-monitor and workflow
tests. Replay does not require Android foreground-service or wake-lock semantics
because it is not live hardware recording.

## V2: In-Phone RTKLIB Real-Time

In-phone RTKLIB real-time solution is planned for version 2. V1 keeps the raw
recording and receiver-side workflows clean so RTKLIB can later be added as an
advisory solution engine without blocking capture.

## Key Risks

- Receiver-native raw observations may not convert to RTCM3 without a supported
  receiver-specific decoder.
- `1 Hz` raw observations are a minimum, not a guarantee of precise static
  positioning.
- Receiver PPP may need correction services, subscriptions or convergence time.
- Early or unconverged PPP positions can be misleading.
- Averaging non-PPP standalone fixes can be biased by metres.
- Moving the base closer to the rover improves baseline geometry but does not
  remove the need for a correct absolute base coordinate.
- A wrong base coordinate can produce precise-looking but wrong rover positions.
- Antenna height, antenna reference point, phase-centre assumptions, frame/datum
  and epoch metadata are part of the measurement, not optional notes.
- A car roof can give good open-sky visibility, but roof shape, rails, nearby
  objects and the antenna ground plane can introduce multipath.
